  - Vertex counting with contour approximation
  - Area ratio calculation (contour area / bounding box area)
  - Aspect ratio analysis
  - Circularity measurement
- **Confidence scoring**: Shape-specific confidence calculation

### 🛠️ Improved Image Preprocessing
- **Simplified and robust preprocessing**: Better contour detection
