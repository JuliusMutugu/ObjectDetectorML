# 🎯 Blind Navigation Assistant

An advanced computer vision system designed to help blind and visually impaired individuals navigate their environment safely and independently.

## 🌟 Overview

This assistive technology transforms visual information into audio feedback, providing real-time navigation assistance through:

- **Real-time object detection** with color and shape identification
- **Zone-based navigation** with spatial awareness
- **Audio feedback** using text-to-speech technology
- **Collision warnings** for immediate hazards
- **Path guidance** for safe navigation

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🔊 Audio Navigation System
- **Real-time voice feedback** about objects and their locations
- **Spatial awareness** with zone-based descriptions (left, right, ahead)
- **Priority-based alerts** (critical, high, medium priority zones)
- **Collision warnings** for immediate obstacles
- **Path guidance** suggesting safe navigation routes

### 👁️ Advanced Object Detection
- **11 color categories**: Red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple, pink, cyan, white, black, gray
- **8 shape categories**: Circle, triangle, rectangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, polygon
- **High accuracy detection** with confidence scoring
- **Real-time processing** at 30 FPS

### 📍 Spatial Navigation Zones
The system divides the camera view into 6 zones:
- **Immediate zones** (high priority): Left, center, right - for objects close to the user
- **Far zones** (medium priority): Far left, far center, far right - for distant objects
- **Critical zone**: Directly ahead - highest priority for collision avoidance

### ♿ Accessibility Features
- **High contrast visualization** for partially sighted users
- **Large text display** for better readability
- **Configurable speech settings** (rate, volume, voice)
- **Audio cooldown system** to prevent information overload

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install opencv-python numpy pyyaml pyttsx3 pygame
```

### Running the Assistant
```bash
# Run the full navigation assistant
python blind_navigation_assistant.py

# Run tests first
python test_navigation.py

# Run basic object detection
python main.py
```

## 🎮 Usage Instructions

### Basic Operation
1. **Start the application**: Run `python blind_navigation_assistant.py`
2. **Position the camera**: Aim the camera in your direction of travel
3. **Listen for audio feedback**: The system will announce detected objects and navigation advice
4. **Follow guidance**: Use the spatial information to navigate safely

### Controls
- **'q'** - Quit the application
- **'v'** - Toggle voice feedback on/off
- **'s'** - Save current navigation log
- **ESC** - Emergency exit

### Audio Feedback Examples
- *"Red circle directly ahead"* - Object identification with location
- *"CAUTION: Obstacle directly ahead"* - Collision warning
- *"Path ahead is clear"* - Safe navigation confirmation
- *"Move left to avoid obstacles"* - Navigation guidance

## 🔧 Configuration

### Audio Settings
Edit `config/navigation_config.yaml`:
```yaml
navigation:
  audio:
    announcement_cooldown: 3.0    # Seconds between announcements
    speech_rate: 180              # Words per minute
    volume: 0.9                   # Volume (0.0 to 1.0)
```

### Detection Sensitivity
```yaml
detection:
  contour:
    min_area: 800          # Minimum object size
    max_area: 80000        # Maximum object size
```

### Zone Priorities
```yaml
navigation:
  zones:
    immediate_priority: "critical"
    far_priority: "medium"
```
